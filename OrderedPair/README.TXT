PROJECT TITLE: ProblemSet 2B
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: OrderedPair
VERSION or DATE: Sept 25, 2023
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
AUTHORS: Erica Lee
USER INSTRUCTIONS:


CONSIDER:
How would you create an OrderedPair object with values (4.0, -5.0) using BlueJ?

    On blueJ, you can right click on the OrderedPair class, and click on the newOrderedPair(double _x, double _y).
    From there, enter the values 4.0 and -5,0 into the perspective boxes. A red object will pop up, double click that and you will find the ordered pair with values 4.0 and -5.0.

How could you do this with code instead? 

    You can create a main string class and include: OrderedPair p = new OrderedPair(4.0, 5); 


What happens if you print an OrderedPair object to the console,the way you might print an int? What does this output mean?

    It gets printed like: OrderedPair@"someRandomCharacters".


Now what happens if you print an OrderedPair object to the console? What changed? 
    
    It would print the ordered pair we expect: (4.0, 5.0);
